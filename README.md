# Hello World ðŸŒŽ
A program in Java that prints "Hello World!!!!!!"

# How to set up environment 
* Download OpenJDK Java 17 with the dmg package.
* Double click on the application and click install.
* You can double check that java and its compiler are installed by running this in your terminal
  ```java --version```
 ``` javac --version```

# How to compile 
I used VSCode to write the Hello World program. I can now compile it, or translate the code so the computer can understand the instructions. 

To compile 
```
javac HelloWorld.java
```
You can check that the program has been compiled by calling for the list of directories. 
```
ls
```

# How to run the program 

```
java HelloWorld 
```

# Potential issues 
* Be careful and remember to name the file with the extension ".java"
* I had worked on a file called "Hello World", realized my mistake, but kept working on the wrong file! As a result, I kept trying to instantiate a class on an empty file.
* Other potential issues include not having compatible versions of java and javac.
